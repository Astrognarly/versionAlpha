The "Roommate Simulator" is in the style of a dating sim game, but with a roommate instead (not a romantic story, just loosely inspired by past bad experiences with bad roommates).

METERS for GOOD/BAD ENDING:

GPA: 
0.00 to 4.00 (You want at least a 3.70 to be competitive for a good graduate program!)
Anything less than or equal to 2.00 GPA = Bad Ending
Anything greater than or equal to 3.50 GPA = Good Ending
So really more like 2.00-3.50 scale?

Frenemy Scale: 
1 to 7 (4 being the starting neutral.) 
Anything less than or equal to 2.5 = Enemy
Anything greater than or equal to 5.5 = Friend

Grades are more important than friendship to the Protagonist, b/c of your personal goal to become a full Professor -> direct impact on Good or Bad Ending. 
Friendship is a supplementary outcome to the Good or Bad Ending.
